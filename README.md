# Frankenstyle

Frankenstyle is the spiritual successor to **Franken UI** — our first project that fused UIkit with Tailwind CSS. This time, we’re rebuilding from the ground up with a sharper focus on simplicity, flexibility, and long-term maintainability.

## Documentation

The documentation website is still being updated, but you can refer to the **context files** for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

## Roadmap

Here’s the current state of the project and where we’re headed next.

While **Franken UI** relied on mature libraries like Tailwind CSS and UIkit, the goal now is to build a more **granular**, **robust**, and **future-proof** foundation — essentially, our own ecosystem. The project is split into three parts:

* **Frankenstyle** – A no-build, value-driven, fully responsive, utility-first CSS framework.
* **Headless Web Components (HWC)** – A collection of unstyled, fully accessible, commonly used web components.
* **FrankenstyleKit** – The fusion of the two, featuring its own opinionated design system inspired by `coss ui`.

Both Frankenstyle and HWC are fully detached and can be used independently — hence the creation of FrankenstyleKit.

## Current Status

* **Frankenstyle** – Development is very active and open to the community.
* **Franken UI** – Now in Long-Term Support (LTS). No new features will be added, but bug fixes and dependency updates are guaranteed.

## Support

Right now, the project is **unsustainable** — it has no commercial backing or paid projects and relies solely on donors, a few sponsors from Franken UI, and, of course, my own boredom and availability.

There’s a lot to do, and I’d love to see this project thrive.
